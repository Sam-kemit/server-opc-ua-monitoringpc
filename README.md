# Server OPC UA PC & Monitoring 

## About this project

Within the framework of the Industrial Data Capture & Publish project, I developed this opc ua server with nodejs so that it can be 
multiplatform in order to monitor our Industrial PCs remotely.
This server makes available (using the OPC UA standard) the hardware and software information of the machine, 
e.g. serial number, manufacturer's name, installed software and patches.
